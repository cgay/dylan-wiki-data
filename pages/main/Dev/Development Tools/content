Here is a list of development tools available for Dylan:

* The {{Open Dylan}} IDE is the a full-featured development environment.  It is
  currently only available on Windows due to no {{DUIM}} back-end support on
  other platforms.

* **Emacs** support for Dylan indentation and colorization can be found in
  `the dylan-mode library <https://github.com/dylan-lang/dylan-mode>`_.

  To enable auto-loading of dylan-mode upon loading a .dylan file, add these
  lines to your .emacs file::

    (setq load-path (cons "<your-git-checkout>/dylan-mode/elisp" load-path))
    (autoload 'dylan-mode "dylan-mode" "Dylan-mode" t)
    (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.dylan\\'" . dylan-mode) auto-mode-alist))

* **Vim** has built-in support Dylan indentation and colorization.

* **View Sources** - Most Dylan projects are hosted on `github.com
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang>`_.  You can browse the sources there.
  See the {{Libraries}} page for specific projects.

* **Report Bugs** - Some projects use Github's issue tracker to track bugs and
  some use the `Bugzilla on opendylan.org
  <https://www.opendylan.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/index.cgi>`_.
  See the {{Libraries}} page for specific projects.

* **dswank** - To enable SLIME with Open Dylan, compile project dswank (located
  in opendylan/sources/environment/dswank)::

    $ OPEN_DYLAN_USER_REGISTRIES=.../opendylan/sources/registry opendylan -build dswank

  The binary will end up in ``~/Open-Dylan/bin/dswank``.

  Then download slime with  ::

    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous:anonymous@common-lisp.net:/project/slime/cvsroot co slime

  Add the following lines to your .emacs file::

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/slime/")  ; your SLIME directory
    (setq inferior-lisp-program "/path/to/dswank") ; your dswank binary
    (require 'slime)
    (slime-setup '(slime-dylan slime-repl))

* **enscript** has Dylan support as of around (?) version 1.6.5.  This is a GNU
  program that can format source code, convert between various page formats,
  and render HTML versions of source code.

* **LTD** - `Lisp to Dylan (LTD) <http://www.norvig.com/ltd/doc/ltd.html>`_ can
  convert Common Lisp code to Dylan, or at least greatly reduce the amount of
  manual labor required.

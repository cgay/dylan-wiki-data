
Open Dylan
==========

{{Open Dylan}} is an open source compiler and IDE with full library
support.  The compiler can generate native code for x86 on Linux,
Windows, and BSD, and has a C back-end that can be used on other
architectures.  The IDE only works on Windows due to lack of debugger
and GUI support on other platforms.  {{Open Dylan}} was originally a
commercial product called "Harlequin Dylan", sold by Harlequin, Inc.
Work on an LLVM back-end is currently (June 2011) underway.


Gwydion Dylan
=============

{{Gwydion Dylan}} is a highly portable open source Dylan to C
compiler that generates fast code slowly.  It is missing some
important libraries like threads and networking.  {{Gwydion Dylan}}
was originally written by the Gwydion group at the Carnegie Mellon
University.

Historical projects
===================

  used to bootstrap Gwydion Dylan up until version 2.5 was released.

* {{Marlais}} is a Dylan interpreter.

* {{Thomas}} was a Dylan written on top of Scheme. It was developed at
  DEC.

* {{Apple Dylan}}, the first released implementation of the language,
  is sadly no longer available.

* {{Dyva}}, a crazy hare-brained scheme to try and make a Dylan system

Open Dylan is a full-featured implementation of the Dylan language
with a powerful IDE and a command-line compiler.  The compiler is
currently available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X (x86 and PPC).
The IDE only works on Windows until the GTK backend for {{DUIM}} is
finished.

Open Dylan started life as a commercial product called Harlequin Dylan
and later, when {{Harlequin}} spun off the Dylan group as {{Functional
Objects}} it was called Functional Developer.  Soon after it was
open-sourced in early 2005 it was renamed to Open Dylan.

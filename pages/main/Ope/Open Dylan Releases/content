* Make sure to delete ~/Open-Dylan on Unix systems.


Open Dylan 1.0 Beta 4
---------------------

Released date:  April 2007


Download
~~~~~~~~

The release binaries are available from `here </static/download/opendylan/1.0beta4/>`_.

This release corresponds to svn revision 11304, tag opendylan-1.0beta4-win32.

The FreeBSD port works only on FreeBSD7, because protection faults handled by
the garbage collector are done via SIGSEGV (was SIGBUS previously)


Windows Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This snapshot has been tested with Windows XP.  As of this snapshot, we support
the following linkers:

* Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 -- This is the linker used to build this
  snapshot, and is currently the best-supported.  (It is no longer available
  for sale without purchasing a "downgrade", however.)

* Microsoft Visual C++ .NET and Microsoft Visual C++ .NET 2003 -- The VC7
  linker can be used to build most programs, but Functional Developer's support
  for the debugging information (i.e., PDB files) it produces is incomplete.
  (See `bug 7078 <http://www.gwydiondylan.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=7078>`_ to
  track progress on this issue.)

* `Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition
  <http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/default.aspx>`_ -- The
  freely downloadable Visual C++ also supplies the VC7 linker.  Since the
  Toolkit is missing a resource compiler, and only a few Win32 import libraries
  are included, it needs to be used in concert with the `Microsoft Platform SDK
  <http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/>`_.

* `Pelles C for Windows <http://www.smorgasbordet.com/pellesc/>`_ -- The freely
  downloadable Pelles C for Windows (version 2.90.1 and later) is fully
  supported, as its linker produces debugging information in the older format.


Ubuntu Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Required dependencies on Ubuntu are listed {{Open Dylan on Ubuntu}}.


Known Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* On Windows you will need to set LIB to point to your Windows .lib files
  (kernel32.lib etc).  PATH must include the linker you're using (link.exe,
  polink.exe, etc) and the directory containing mspdb80.dll.  INCLUDE must
  include the directory containing windows.h.  The installer doesn't set these
  up for you.

* On Windows there are reports of files staying locked by the IDE such that
  they can't be edited etc.  This is thought to be due to a bug in
  dbghelp.dll. Installing a sufficiently recent dbghelp.dll (from Microsoft or
  from our SVN) in ``$(PROGRAM_FILES)\Open Dylan\bin`` should fix it. (Error
  message is ``LINK : fatal error LNK1201: error writing to program database
  'C:\build\bin\duim-gl-demo.pdb'; check for insufficient disk space, invalid
  path, or insufficient privilege``)

* If you want to use the IDE to build itself, please follow instructions at
  {{Build win32-environment with opendylan}}


Reporting Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Windows IDE can be run under batch-debug.exe, which will write out a full
backtrace (of all threads) to standard output in the event of a crash.

Please report any problems via `bugzilla
<http://www.opendylan.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=OpenDylan>`_.


The 1.0 beta 4 announcement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  Dear Dylan Hacker,

  I am proud to announce the Open Dylan 1.0 beta 4 release. This is the
  first public release for all supported platforms: Windows (x86), Linux
  (x86), FreeBSD (x86), Mac OS X (ppc and x86). The IDE is still only
  available on Windows so far, on all other OS only a batch-compiler is
  working. But we are working on a GTK+ 2.x backend for DUIM.

  The release was done by the Dylan Maintainers, a group of Dylan users
  all over the world, communicating via the gd-hackers@gwydiondylan.org
  mailing list as well as via IRC, irc.freenode.net, channel #dylan.
  Please let us know about any problems you encounter.

  Open Dylan was formerly known as Functional Developer, formerly known
  as Harlequin Dylan.


The released binaries are available `here
</static/download/opendylan/1.0beta4/>`_.


Partial list of resolved issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The c back end of DFMC works now, and is used on Mac OS X. This eases porting
  the compiler to various architectures.

* 'macroexpand expression' is now working in system and user projects. This can
  be invoked either via the IDE or via the interactive compiler environment.

* SO_REUSEADDR is set on sockets opened, so an application can open a socket
  which has old connections in use. No need to wait until connections are gone
  from TIME_WAIT state. This only affects the UNIX OS.

* "{complex type}" was shown when a non-class type was used somewhere. This was
  not very helpful in the IDE as well as in error messages of the compiler.

* expiration checks are removed. When developed commercially, all libraries had
  an expiration date, which is no longer useful because the source is public
  now.

* a primitive stack walker has been implemented for UNIX. This helps to debug
  Dylan applications, because gdb does not work for them.

* streams were not locked, so race conditions were possible. We chose to be
  better safe than sorry, and all streams are now locked by default.

* On linux, __errno_location was used to get the value of errno when a system
  call failed. This is no longer supported by glibc and lead to crashes.

* In the IDE all possible restarts were labeled with "Undescribed restart",
  which was not really useful. This was an initialization problem.

* The IDE editor had the problem "#f is not of type {<class>: <basic-line>}"
  when adding a line to a definition shown in multiple buffers.

* The IDE didn't support breakpoints in dependent projects because the list of
  libraries was not initialized correctly.

* IDE: Force links of projects by default

* IDE: Fix annoying scrolling bug in deuce.

* IDE: Windows can be larger than the size of the primary display.

* IDE: Adding and removing elements to list views was broken in a corner case.

* IDE: LVS_EX_FULLROWSELECT is now used; this enables a user to select any
  column of a table instead of only the first.

* Bug 7338 is fixed.

* Bug 7323 is fixed.

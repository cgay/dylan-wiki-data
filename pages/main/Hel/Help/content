{{escape: "[[" "]]"}}

Most formatting for this wiki is done by ReStructured Text (RST).
There is a small amount of additional markup language added on top
of RST to provide links to other wiki objects such as pages, users,
and groups.

**Help on Wiki Markup**

This wiki adds some markup on top of the existing RST markup.
All wiki markup start with ``{{`` and ends with ``}}``.  Because
page links are expected to be the most common by far, they have an
optional shortened syntax.  ::

    {{page: Foo, text: Bar}}    -- link text "Bar" to page "Foo"
    {{Foo,Bar}}                 -- shorthand for {{page:Foo,text:Bar}}
    {{Foo}}                     -- shorthand for {{page:Foo,text:Foo}}
    {{page: "x,y"}}             -- names may be quoted
    {{page: 'The "x" Page'}}    -- single or double quotes work.
    {{user: jdoe, text: Jon}}   -- a user link
    {{group: group}}            -- a group link
    {{include: Page}}           -- include Page's content in the current page
    {{escape: "((" "))"}}       -- use (( and )) instead of {{ and }}

The wiki pre-parser knows nothing about RST parsing.  It simply
searches the raw markup for ``{{`` and assumes that's a wiki
directive.  If you need to put a literal ``{{`` or ``}}`` in the
generated output it can be done by changing the escape character
sequences via the {{escape: ...}} directive.

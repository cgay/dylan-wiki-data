    *Dylan is an advanced, object-oriented, dynamic language which
    supports rapid program development.  When needed, programs can be
    optimized for more efficient execution by supplying more type
    information to the compiler.  Nearly all entities in Dylan
    (including functions, classes, and basic data types such as
    integers) are first class objects. Additionally Dylan supports
    multiple inheritance, polymorphism, multiple dispatch, keyword
    arguments, object introspection, macros, and many other advanced
    features...  --Peter Hinely*

For more on the background and goals of the Dylan language, see the
excellent `Introduction to the Dylan Reference Manual </books/drm/drm_6.html>`_.

To get a quick feel of the language have a look at some
{{code examples}}.

Compilers}}.

2011.12.25 -- Open Dylan LLVM back-end

    Open Dylan now uses the LLVM back-end by default, thus leveraging
    all of its optimizations and platform support.

2011.08.01 -- New Wiki Goes Live

    The Dylan wiki (both the implementation and the wiki content) have
    been almost completely rewritten.  The wiki software itself now uses
    augmented ReStructured Text as its markup language and uses Git for
    its backing storage, as well as substantial other changes.

Around 1993 the Computer Science department at `CMU
<http://www.cs.cmu.edu>`_ (Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh,
USA) headed by Scott Fahlmann began a `research project to develop an
advanced programming environment
<http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gwydion/gwydion-overview.html>`_, focusing on
support for evolutionary development. As part of this development, the
Gwydion team collaborated with {{Apple Cambridge}} and {{Harlequin}}
to design the {{Dylan Language}}, and developed an interpreter and
compiler for the language.

In 1997/1998 the support for the `Gwydion Project at CMU
<http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/gwydion/docs/htdocs/gwydion/>`_
was terminated, and `the research group
<http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/gwydion/docs/htdocs/gwydion/biographs.html>`_
released their implementation into the public domain.

In the summer of 1998, the gd-hackers team was formed to take over
maintainance of Gwydion Dylan, and is now known as the dylan-hackers.
